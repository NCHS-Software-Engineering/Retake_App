I caught the guy who tried to kick down our door last weekend. It was quite a funny conversation. I have rarely been so passive-aggressive.\n\n\n\nBasically, he parked his big Mercedes van in front of our door and someone kicked the van and it did damage.\n\n\n\nHis friend lives a street away and told him it was us (which it obviously wasn't, I dislike violence and damaging people's stuff).\n\n\n\nSo after a bit of a talk, he opens his van, takes out a wet wipe, and starts cleaning our door, and two hours later he came back and gave us two very nice beers.\n\n\n\nSo we invited him over and had a drink with him.\n\n\n\nQuite a nice guy actually, he was very sorry.
