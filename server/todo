Auth side:
    1. Make db of users, have it include, hash password, email, username
    2. Find hashing string tool instead of bcrypt since it has mem leaks?
    3. Finnish the querys to the login and signin with sql database

DB side:
    1. Everyone needs to come and think about how our database is going to get setup
    2. How our app will handle new tests, how our json will get send out to frontend to render ect

Frontend:
    1. Create shell to the frontend for each page
    2. Once db routes finnished, finnish the frontend (in mean time test with test json data, DB step comes first)
