Auth side:
    1. Make db of users, have it include, hash password, email, username
    2. Find hashing string tool instead of bcrypt since it has mem leaks?
    3. Finnish the querys to the login and signin with sql database

DB side:
    1. Everyone needs to come and think about how our database is going to get setup
    2. How our app will handle new tests, how our json will get send out to frontend to render ect

Frontend:
    1. Create shell to the frontend for each page
    2. Once db routes finnished, finnish the frontend (in mean time test with test json data, DB step comes first)


LATER PROBLEMS:
    1. When I create JWT TOKEN I use there username too, if they change that in settings, in the settings need to give them new accessToken

LATER TODO:
    1. For dashboard, make the routes go to /dash/student/tracker so its not /dash/tracker for teachers to beacuse that route does not exist for teachers?
        1.1. Mabye instead of using username in token use the user ID, so it would be faster to query their user (WILL DO)
    2. Make access-token more secure (more settings)
    3. Make it so there can be more than 1 teacher per class
