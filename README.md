# RetakeAppAustinJackMitch

## Project overview:
1. What the project does:
- This project lets teachers manage and give our their retakes more efficently by lettings students email them or signup directly though the website to take a retake. Teachers then see the test that they have to retake and give them retake questions based on what quetsions they got wrong durring the actual test. 
3. How does it work:
- This project works by using an ExpressJS server to make queries to the SQL database to manage data in the following tables users (teachers/students), classes, tests, questions, and retake requests. This is all accessiable by using our interface we render out to the client using EJS from our server. By using EJS we can make the UI look very easy to use while keeping the advanced logic in the backend.
